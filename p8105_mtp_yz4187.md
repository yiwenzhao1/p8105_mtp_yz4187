### Introduction

This project will use the correction data used in the report describing
the relationship between posture and “enlarged protuberances” among
young people which published in 2018 Nature Scientific Reports and try
to find out a new analysis on the relationship through the new
correction data.

### Problem 1 - Data

``` r
df = read_excel("p8105_mtp_data.xlsx", range = "A9:I1230") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
df$eop_size_mm[is.na(df$eop_size_mm)] = 0
df$eop_shape[is.na(df$eop_shape)] = mean(df$eop_shape,na.rm = TRUE)
df$fhp_size_mm[is.na(df$fhp_size_mm)] = mean(df$fhp_size_mm,na.rm = TRUE)
sum(is.na(df))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
df %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 0,"female", "male"),
         eop_detected = ifelse(eop_size_mm == 0, "0","1")) %>%
  select(sex, age_group, eop_size, fhp_category, eop_detected) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex    |   n |
|:-------|----:|
| female | 614 |
| male   | 607 |

``` r
df %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 0,"female", "male"),
         eop_detected = ifelse(eop_size_mm == 0, "0","1")) %>%
  select(sex, age_group, eop_size, fhp_category, eop_detected) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| age\_group |   n |
|:-----------|----:|
| 2          | 303 |
| 4          | 207 |
| 3          | 204 |
| 5          | 200 |
| 6          | 178 |
| 7          | 126 |
| 1          |   2 |
| 8          |   1 |

**Description: ** The data cleaning process starts with replacing all
the na with either a zero (since the missing eop\_size(mm) in the
dataset is 0) or the mean value (since the mean value will not affect
the results of following calculations). The key variables are sex,
age\_group, eop\_size, fhp\_category. One categorical variable
“eop\_detected” has been added to the data table to define whether the
eop is detected. There are 1221 participants in total, and there are 614
females and 607 males. The the most participantsare in the 18-30 age
group, and 914 participants are under 60.
