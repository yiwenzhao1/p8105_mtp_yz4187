### Introduction

This project will use the correction data used in the report describing
the relationship between posture and “enlarged protuberances” among
young people which published in 2018 Nature Scientific Reports and try
to find out a new analysis on the relationship through the new
correction data.

### Problem 1 - Data

``` r
df = read_excel("p8105_mtp_data.xlsx", range = "A9:I1230") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
df$eop_size_mm[is.na(df$eop_size_mm)] = 0
df$eop_shape[is.na(df$eop_shape)] = mean(df$eop_shape,na.rm = TRUE)
df$fhp_size_mm[is.na(df$fhp_size_mm)] = mean(df$fhp_size_mm,na.rm = TRUE)
sum(is.na(df))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
df %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 0,"female", "male"),
         eop_detected = ifelse(eop_size_mm == 0, "0","1")) %>%
  select(sex, age_group, eop_size, fhp_category, eop_detected) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            ) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex    |   n |
|:-------|----:|
| female | 614 |
| male   | 607 |

``` r
df %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 0,"female", "male"),
         eop_detected = ifelse(eop_size_mm == 0, "0","1"),
         age_group = fct_collapse(age_group, "6" = c("6","7","8"))
         ) %>%
  select(sex, age_group, eop_size, fhp_category, eop_detected) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| age\_group |   n |
|:-----------|----:|
| 6          | 305 |
| 2          | 303 |
| 4          | 207 |
| 3          | 204 |
| 5          | 200 |
| 1          |   2 |

**Description:** The data cleaning process starts with replacing all the
na with either a zero (since the missing eop\_size(mm) in the dataset is
0) or the mean value (since the mean value will not affect the results
of following calculations). The key variables are sex, age\_group,
eop\_size, fhp\_category. One categorical variable “eop\_detected” has
been added to the data table to define whether the eop is detected.
There are 1221 participants in total, and there are 614 females and 607
males. The the most participants are in the 18-30 age group, and 914
participants are under 60.

**Answer:** The authors’ stated sample sizes in each group are not
consistent with the data we have but no big difference. The sample size
we have is: 18–30 n=303, 31–40 n=204, 41–50 n=207, 51–60 n=200 and
&gt;60 n=305. The mean of FHP is approximately consistent with the
authors’ data. EEOP is the enlarged EOP which have exceeded 10 mm in
size. Variables can used to evaluate this claim are EEOP\_size\_mm and
number of participants. The prevalence of EEOP is 55.98%, which is not
consistent with the authors’ data.The FHP is more common in older
subjects. From our data, the FHP&gt;40mm is observed 32.89% in over 60s
cases, which is a little lower than the authors’ data.
